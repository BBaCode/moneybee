## General Information

- This project was the final capstone project for my bootcamp at Brainstation
- We were given just under 2 weeks to build it from start to finish
- The purpose of this app is to teach users about personal finance (primarily focused on high schoolers/college students)

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Node.js
- Express.js
- React Router
- Web APIs
- Axios
- SASS
- CORS

## Setup

Working towards a deployed version of this project but in the mean time feel free to install a version locally by:

    run npm i in both the client and server folders.
    run npm start in the client folder to start the front end.
    run node server.js in the server folder to start the back end.

## Usage

MoneyBee is designed to be a mobile app within the browser. After clicking login, you can navigate through any of the 4 options (Learn, Calculator, Account or Resources). I recommend starting with the Learn module as that is the main purpose of the app.

## Project Status

Project is: in progress! You can consider this to be version 1.

## Room for Improvement

To do:

- User Authentication
- Implementation of a Database to store user info
- Addition of a practice test to help solidify learning
